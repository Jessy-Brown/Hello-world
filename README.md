# Hello-world
Hi everyone,

This is my first time using GitHub, I am looking at learning to Code so i can get a new career and move to Australia.
I have learnt HTML/HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, and some Ruby/RubyonRails.
I would love to work as a Front End Developer in Sydney or Brisbane.

Thanks for reading.

Jess.
